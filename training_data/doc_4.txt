The human resource policy of a company is crucial for maintaining a healthy and productive work environment. One important aspect of this policy is the provision of health insurance for all employees. At Happy HR, we prioritize the health and well-being of our employees and therefore provide mandatory health insurance for all our employees.

If you are new to the company, it is important that you create a new form and add your personal health insurance information. If you need to change your current health insurance, you can also create a new form and select the option for a new health insurance plan, including the effective date of the change. This process ensures that all employee health insurance information is up to date and accurate, which is crucial for effective management of healthcare benefits.

It is important to note that health insurance is mandatory for all bank employees at Happy HR. If you are new to the country and need information regarding health insurance, please contact our health department at health@happy_hr.com. We are committed to providing our employees with the best possible healthcare benefits and are always available to answer any questions or concerns you may have.

For contractors, the topic of health insurance must be handled by the contractor. It is not the responsibility of Happy HR to provide health insurance for contractors, as they are not considered employees of the company. However, we recommend that all contractors obtain their own health insurance to ensure that they are adequately covered in case of any health-related issues.

Working students and student-practice employees are also eligible for mandatory health insurance provided by Happy HR. If you are a new employee in either of these categories, please create a new form and add your personal health insurance information. If you need to change your current health insurance, you can also create a new form and select the option for a new health insurance plan, including the effective date of the change.

In conclusion, the human resource policy of a company is crucial for maintaining a healthy and productive work environment. At Happy HR, we prioritize the health and well-being of our employees and provide mandatory health insurance for all our employees, including working students and student-practice employees. If you have any questions or concerns regarding health insurance, please do not hesitate to contact our health department at health@happy_hr.com.
