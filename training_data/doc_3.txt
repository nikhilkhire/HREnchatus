The human resource policies of a company are crucial to ensuring that employees are aware of their rights and responsibilities. The working rules table provides guidelines for holidays for different categories of employees. In this text, we will discuss the policies and procedures for holidays for working students and student-practice employees in Germany.

Working students are employees who are pursuing their studies while working part-time. They are entitled to 40 or 20 days of holidays per year, depending on their contract. To apply for holidays, they need to follow a specific process. Firstly, they need to select the \"load holidays\" option in the software provided by the company. Secondly, they need to mark the dates they want to take off. After this, they need to submit the request and wait for approval from their manager. It is essential to note that working students can take a maximum of 30 days of holidays per year. Additionally, the holidays are valid until December of the following year.

Student-practice employees are individuals who are doing an internship as part of their studies. They are not entitled to any holidays during their internship period. This is because internships are usually short-term, and the focus is on acquiring skills and experience rather than taking time off. Therefore, student-practice employees need to be aware that they cannot take any holidays during their internship period.

It is essential to note that the policies regarding holidays for working students and student-practice employees are in line with the German labour laws. According to the German law, employees are entitled to at least 20 days of holidays per year. Therefore, the company's policy of offering 40 days of holidays to working students is generous and provides an incentive for students to work and study at the same time.

The policy of allowing employees to take a maximum of 30 days of holidays per year is also in line with the German law. The law stipulates that employees can take a maximum of 24 days of holidays per year. Therefore, the company's policy of allowing employees to take up to 30 days of holidays per year is generous and provides employees with an opportunity to take a break from work and recharge.

The process of applying for holidays through the software provided by the company is also efficient and ensures that employees' requests are handled promptly. By using the software, employees can submit their requests from anywhere, and their managers can approve or reject the requests remotely. This saves time and ensures that employees' requests are handled promptly.

In conclusion, the human resource policies regarding holidays for working students and student-practice employees in Germany are clear and in line with the German labour laws. The policies provide employees with an opportunity to take a break from work and recharge while ensuring that the company's operations are not disrupted. The process of applying for holidays through the software provided by the company is efficient and ensures that employees' requests are handled promptly."
